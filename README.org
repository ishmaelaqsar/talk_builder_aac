* Talk Builder AAC - Sentence Building for Early Intervention

Talk Builder AAC is a Flutter application designed for children (ages 2-5) who are ready to transition from single words to building sentences.

Unlike general AAC apps that can be overwhelming, this app bridges the gap between simple "choice boards" and complex communication systems. It introduces the concept of a **Sentence Strip** while maintaining the **safety** and **simplicity** of the original /Toddler Talk/ philosophy[cite: 2].

** 🌟 Features

*** 🗣️ Builder Mode (The Default)
- **Visual Sentence Strip:** Tapping icons adds them to a top bar, allowing the child to construct thoughts (e.g., "I" + "Want" + "Apple") before speaking.
- **"Speak" Button:** A large, distinct button reads the entire sentence at a natural pace.
- **Correction Tools:** Includes a "Backspace" and "Clear" button to help children learn through trial and error without frustration.
- **Sage Green Theme:** A calming, focus-oriented color palette designed to distinguish this "big kid" app from the toddler version[cite: 7].

*** 👩‍👦 Mom Mode (Admin)
- **Safety Lock:** Access editing tools by **Long Pressing** the lock icon (top right)[cite: 8].
- **Custom Photos:** Use the camera to add your child's specific toys, foods, or people[cite: 9].
- **Visibility Toggles:** "Hide" cards that are no longer relevant without deleting them permanently.
- **Backward Compatibility:** Seamlessly import backups from *Toddler Talk* so you don't have to retake all your photos.
